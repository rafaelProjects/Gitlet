# Gitlet

# Description
Version Control System, inspired by Git. This Version Control System mimics some of the basic features of the popular version control system Git. Gitlet supports operations such as staging/unstaging files, merging, removing, rebasing and interactively rebasing branches. It also utilizes SCP to provide for remote operations such as pulling, pushing and cloning branches remotely. Written in Java.

# Code
I cannot post the code for this project since I am still a student at UC Berkeley. If I were to post this code, my education could be jeopardized since that is against cheating policies. If you want the code, send me an email and I will gladly send it to you.
